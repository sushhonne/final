          <h3>When do we invest</h3>
          <p>
            WE like to partner with founders early in their journeywhere we can
            add the most value
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>How early?</h3>
          <p>
            Right at the "I and my co-founder(s) were thinking that market X
            seems to be broken in a weird way" stage. As an example, one of our
            first investments was in a startup where the founder still had 8
            months of college left!
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>Cheque Size</h3>
          <p>
            The combined cheque size from our network(in 2022) tends to be about
            $100k - $300k
          </p>

        <div class="b">
          <h3>Investment Tracks</h3>
          <p>
            Track1: If you do not have a lead investor, we are happy to take an
            independent call and set the terms
          </p>
          <p>
            Track2: If you have a lead investor, we are happy to follow the
            terms that are already set for the round and focus on adding the
            value through our network
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>Terms</h3>
          <p>
            We focus ferociously on having the least amount of friction possible
            in round construction because we believe that nitpicking for rights
            at early stages does not create value for anyone
